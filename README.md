# lambda

A proof of concept self-hosted micro architecture heavily inspired by AWS Lambda.

## Features
- Compatible with AWS Lambda - the same artifacts will work
- Meant to be self-hosted

## TODO
- lambda-generator - generate a complete tar.gz or Docker container which includes an API gateway
- lambda-metrics
- lambda-scheduler

## Half-baked ideas
- Use lambdas to generate other lambdas
- lambda chaining and/or side car lambdas
- lambda marketplace
