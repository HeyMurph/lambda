# lambda

A proof of concept self-hosted micro architecture heavily inspired by [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

## Features
- Compatible with AWS Lambda - the same artifacts will work
- Meant to be self-hosted

## TODO
- generator
    - complete Spring Boot jar
    - Docker image
    - HTTP client
- metrics
- scheduler

## Half-baked ideas
- Use lambdas to generate other lambdas
- chaining and/or side car lambdas
- marketplace
